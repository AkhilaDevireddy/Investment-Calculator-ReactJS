# TroubleShooting

If you're facing any issues with vite package, reset the node_modules using:
- rm -rf node_modules
- rm package-lock.json  (# Optional, but can help resolve version issues)
- npm install
- npm install vite --save-dev

NOTE: Don't modify/remove `package.json` file manually,
as the installations use this file to decide which packages are to be installed during `npm install`.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
